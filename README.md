# 💼 Credit Risk Analysis Using Random Forest

This project uses a machine learning approach to predict credit risk — specifically identifying the likelihood of a loan being charged off. A **Random Forest** model was used and compared against baseline models like **Logistic Regression** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes information about loan applicants, such as:

- Age, Income, Employment Length  
- Loan Purpose (Intent), Loan Amount, Interest Rate  
- Home Ownership, Credit History Length, Previous Default Status  
- Loan Approval Status (Target Variable)

**Source:** `credit_risk.csv`
